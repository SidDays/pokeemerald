# Elite Four

Theme: attack styles

## Pan
Theme: Defense

Hiya, how's it going?
I'm Pan of the Elite Four!
My Pokémon are super tough and
resilient!
They can take a hit or two before
they destroy you.
Go ahead and show me whatchu got!

(Post-battle-text)

You showed that you are a worthy
opponent. Go ahead!


## Libra
Theme: Balance

I am Libra of the Elite Four.
I believe that a good trainer can
strike a balance between offense
and defense.
Our battle will show you what I mean.

It appears you have already mastered
the art of balance…
