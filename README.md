# Pokémon Emerald Hack

## Introduction

I (Sidrk) am making a Pokémon Hack!
It doesn't have a name yet, neither a set story. Frankly, I've barely finished any work on it yet.
But stay tuned! Perhaps I can make the next [Pokémon Gaia](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=326118) ~~or even better lol~~

It builds the following rom:

* pokeemerald.gba

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
