# Pokémon Emerald

## About this branch

Uses the sound option in the player settings to toggle background music (BGM) instead with the SFX intact; replaces the Mono setting with BGM Off and Stereo setting with BGM On (there's no reason to play the game in Mono anyway.)

It can easily be modified to user another option if required. Just look at `StopOrPlayBGM` in [option_menu.c](src/option_menu.c).

This is especially useful to play the game with increased speed, or to accompany a soundtrack of your choice.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
